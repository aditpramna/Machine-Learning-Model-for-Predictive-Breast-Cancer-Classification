About Project:

Description: In this project, we harness the power of machine learning to develop a classification model aimed at predicting breast cancer outcomes for a renowned health institution. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset that encompasses patient histories, genetic markers, and diagnostic imaging results, our model seeks to provide early and accurate predictions, facilitating timely interventions and treatments. The primary goal is to enhance patient care by enabling healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques with medical expertise, this endeavor not only elevates the standards of diagnostic procedures but also holds the potential to drastically improve patient prognosis and survival rates.

Result: Develop a breast cancer classification model using machine learning that can achieve classification Recall Score above 95% on a test dataset within 6 months. This model will help in early diagnosis of breast cancer and will be ready for clinical integration within 1 year.
